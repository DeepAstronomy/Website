# It's Been A Fun Ride

I've been making astronomy content online since 2006 and while I've enjoyed a small measure of success, it wasn't my cup of tea.  Turns out being internet famous is not a good thing for me and while I wanted to keep creating astronomy videos on YouTube, the environment and the workload proved more than I was willing to put in.

# But I Do Enjoy Making Astronomy Content

![An image](/assets/images/everyone-loves-astronomy.png){: .align-right} Being internet famous may not be my cup of tea, but I do still want to continue creating content.  I've been thinking about the best way to move forward and while I work this out, I'm creating this landing page for Deep Astronomy to hold my place.

There are always many options in a situation like this, and I'm trying to decide on the best one.  I may create content for other to use and license to them.  I may make several podcasts and syndicate them, the list goes on.  I'm very active on the [Deep Astronomy Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Fn6jSVQ8dS) so feel free to pop by and let me know what you think!
