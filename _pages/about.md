<h1>So this is how the story goes... </h1>
It all started on labor day 2006, I had just gotten my first Macbook after decades of avoiding Apple products.

And on this laptop was a thing called iMovie and you could make videos with it.

A thing about me: I've grown up and lived my life loving astronomy and from high school I have worked in various planetaria (you know, the things with a big dome in them projecting stars - usually found as part of a museum).

Another thing:  I love sharing astronomy with others, so me and planetaria were a great fit.

But then along comes the internet, and Apple makes iMovie and puts it on all of them, and also YouTube is born (this was before Google bought it).
This is a test to see how to enter **content**.
